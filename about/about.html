        <p class="text" text-align="left"><h2><b>"Every Business Begins With A Story"</b></h2></p>
        <p class="text">Hello Guys!!!<br>
            I am janvi Balar,together with my two colleagues margi and krish we founded FRESCO.
            we are selling custom hand made paintings which are drwan by us.
            we were classmates since ouyr childhood and all three of us are very much interested in art and painting work so after completing our std 10 we decided to start a small business so that we can even utilise our talent and can also make some earnings and the main reason to start this is that we enjoy making paintings 
            we adpted three agendas for these <br>

           <b> 1.Be that good</b><br>
            
            one of margi's favorite quotes is that of leonardo da vinci--"make sure it is so good it doen't die with you" margi strives for perfection on every canvas .he does not track time when he's painting,because he allows nothing to detract from his sole focus of putting onto canvas what leaves within him.For margi,it's not just about making art,it's about making art so good that it will live forever. 
            we adpted three agendas for these <br>

           <b> 2.Be disruptive</b><br>
            
            krish says that it is impossible to impact any person unless you disrupt or disturb then. We live in a world where communication is coming al us 24-7 from phones, email, text, voice, television and other outlets. If you can't be heard, you cannot create impact, Giovanni says that he aims to create art that disrupts people who they see it, because by doing so, he can get into their head and create an impact, even just for a moment.
            So il is true in business. If you want to creale fraction for your business, you need to get good al stopping people in their tracks, disrupting old behavior and making them think.
<br>
           <b> 3.Be a free thinker.</b><br>
            
            Ido my best to avoid watching television or reading media, because too oflen, it is just a one-sided communication of the facts.i always say that the  art requires  a free-thinker, so i always stick to learning facts by studying history and then creating his own interpretations
            The way this has transcended business for me is that I constantly have my head buried in books and case studies, always trying to find out how someone else would solve the issue af hand. krish  has taught me how to better rely on my own intuition and my own past experiences to make solid decisions for the future of my business
            with all these ideas of us we are currently growing in our business</p>
